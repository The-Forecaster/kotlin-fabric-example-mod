# Kotlin Example Mod

If you've wanted a mod template for fabric that is ready with kotlin then you're in luck! This was designed to be as similar to the [fabric example mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) as possible.

If you're looking program your own mod then consider adding in parts of the kotlin standard library

1. kotlin-stdlib-jdk8 adds functionality to work with Java 8 and is required by other parts of the std-lib
2. kotlin-reflect allows you to examine classes and do actions on a deeper level
3. [kotlinx-coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) isn't part of the std-lib, but it is super useful in allowing you to program asynchronously

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.

## License

This template is available under the MIT license. Feel free to learn from it and incorporate it in your own projects.
